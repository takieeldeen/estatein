Additional Notes:

Consider replacing the placeholder component names in the project structure with your actual components.
If the website doesn't utilize Supabase, remove the mention in the documentation and provide instructions for your chosen database.
For data scraping, ensure the practice adheres to website terms of service and ethical data acquisition principles. Explore alternative data sources or public APIs if possible.
Deployment:

Consult Next.js documentation for deployment options, such as Vercel, Netlify, or traditional web hosting with server-side configuration.
